		</h4>

        <strong><li>Payments through the Solution</li></strong>
		<h4>
		Upon placing an order and before initiating the charging sessions or use of Rimone’s services, You agree to pay using the payment methods indicated and grant authorization to Company and/or the applicable third party payment-processor to charge Your payment methods indicated in prepaid or post-paid methods.

		<br><br>
		</h4>
		<ul>
        <h4>
		<strong><li>Loading Funds</li></strong>
		The Solution may require You to load some value to Your account using Your credit or debit card or other payment options on file in order to make payments at Company’s electric vehicle charging stations using the Solution. Any value that You load to Your account is a prepayment for the goods and services offered to You through the Solution. While you may be required to provide your credit and debit card or other payment information to enroll in the Solution, the Solution may not charge your payment method until your first attempt to purchase time at one of Company’s electric vehicle charging stations using the Solution, notwithstanding any applicable subscription fee. Any value You have previously loaded to Your account will be refunded back to the original payment method You used to load funds to Your account if you wish to cancel/delete your enrollment in the Solution with a written consent to the company. The value You load to Your account is not insured by any Insurance Corporation and does not earn any interest. Company may impose limits on the amount of value that You may load to Your account. Company may require that You load a minimum amount to Your account in order to use the account’s payment functionalities or other features. Company may change these limits in its sole discretion and at any time without notice to You. There may be a delay from the time You load value to when the value is available for use through the Solution.
		<br><br> 
        <strong> <li>Reloading of Funds </strong></li>
        To use the Solution to make payments, You may be required to agree to the Solution’s automatic reload feature. The Solution will reload Your account by automatically charging the credit or debit card credentials or the other payment option you provided that You have stored through the Solution whenever Your account balance falls below a certain, defined amount. The Company will send You an email confirming the details of the automatic reload terms after You sign up. When the funds in Your account fall below the defined threshold the Company will automatically charge Your credit or debit card or the payment method to reload amount You have selected. Company will send You a confirmation email after each reload purchase. You can change Your reload preferences at any time through the Solution, but changes may take up to twenty-four (24) hours to go into effect. Once Your payment method is charged, the transaction cannot be reversed. You may cancel automatic reloading by deleting your account, either by calling Customer Assistance at phone number given on company’s official website.
		<br><br>
        <strong><li>Fees</strong></li> 
		Except as provided in this Agreement or by the Company in writing, Company does not charge any activation, service, dormancy or inactivity fees in connection with Your account. There is no expiration date for the value on Your account.
		<br><br>
        <strong><li>Transaction History</strong></li>
		You are responsible for checking Your transaction history to ensure that Your transaction history and account balance are accurate. You can check Your transaction history and balance through the Solution. If You have questions regarding Your transaction history or balance, or if You wish to dispute any transaction, please call Customer Assistance given on the company’s official website or even reach out through email ID. Company will review Your claim and correct any error promptly after finishing its review. Company has no obligation to review or correct any billing error unless You provide notice within sixty (60) days of the date of the transaction in question.
        <br><br>
		</h4>
		</ul>
		
        <strong><li>Subsciption Plans</li></strong>
		<h4>
		The Solution/Service may provide You the option to sign up for a monthly subscription plan that provides discounted pricing at Company’s network of electric vehicle charging stations for a monthly/quarterly/annual fee. Discounts may vary depending on the region, so please check the Plan Details for more information regarding the discounts offered for charging stations located in your region. There is no minimum purchase obligation for this subscription, so the specified discounts will remain in     effect regardless of how many charging sessions you purchase during the subscription term. In order to begin Your subscription plan, Company may require You to provide an acceptable means of payment, such as a valid credit or debit card or making a small transaction to verify your payment method. Some subscription plans may have differing conditions and limitations, which will be disclosed at Your sign-up or in other communications made available to You. You can find specific details regarding Your subscription through the Solution by accessing the “Plan details” menu item under the Profile menu in the Solution.
		<br><br>
        <ul>
		<h4>
		<strong><li>Automatic Renewal</li></strong>
		Your subscription plan will continue month/quarter/annual-to-month/quarter/annual and automatically renew until terminated. You must cancel Your membership before it renews each month in order to avoid billing of the next month's membership fee to Your payment method on file.
		<br><br>		
        <strong><li>Payment</li></strong>
		You will need to provide Company with authorization to charge Your credit or debit card or other payment method provided by you on a recurring basis. The fee for the subscription plan will be charged to Your payment method on file at the time of enrolment and then each month thereafter until Your Account is funded following Your first use of the Solution at one of Company’s electric vehicle charging stations. Once Your Account is funded, the monthly subscription fee will be deducted from Your Account balance each month on the calendar day corresponding to the commencement of the paying portion of Your subscription until Your membership is cancelled. Subscription fees are fully earned upon payment. In some cases Your payment date may change, for example if Your payment method has not successfully settled or if Your paid membership began on a day not contained in a given month. You can find specific details on Your next payment date through the Solution by viewing your Billing Details. You authorize Company to charge any payment method associated to Your account in case Your primary payment method is declined or no longer available to Company for payment of Your subscription fee. You remain responsible for any uncollected amounts. If a payment is not successfully settled, due to expiration, insufficient funds, or otherwise, and You do not cancel Your account, Company may suspend Your access to the service until Company has successfully charged a valid payment method.
		<br><br>
        <strong><li>Cancellation</li></strong>
		You can cancel or terminate Your subscription plan at any time using the mobile app or the web portal. Company will not provide refunds or credits for subscription fees for any partial-month subscription periods.
		<br><br>
        <strong><li>Changes to Terms </li></strong>
		Company may change the terms of the subscription plans or adjust pricing at any time without prior notice as Company may determine in its sole discretion. Except as otherwise expressly provided for in these Terms of Service.
		<br><br>
        <strong><li>Limitations </li></strong> 
		Use of the subscription plan is non-transferable. The sale, barter, transfer or assignment of any subscription plan benefits is strictly prohibited. Without limiting any other remedies, Company may suspend or terminate any subscription plan if it suspects, in its sole discretion, that any member or other person has engaged in fraudulent activity in connection with the subscription plan, including without limitation by providing personal information that is untrue, inaccurate or not current.
		<br><br>
        </h4>
		</ul>
		</h4>
		
		<strong><li>Charging Pricing</li></strong>
		<h4>
        The charging pricing including taxes shown when logged onto the Site, the App, or at a charging station (“Charging Pricing”) represents the per-minute/per-unit or percentage-wise-charging pricing charged during entire charging session and is based on the rate of charge Your vehicle communicates to the charging station that it can receive. Actual speed of charge may vary during the charging session and may fall below the Charging Pricing due to factors such as vehicle capacity at start of charging, temperature, battery age, vehicle efficacy, vehicle usage, and power output of the charging station. By using the Solution or any other payment mechanism to purchase time at a charging station, You understand these factors and agree to pay the Charging Pricing disclosed through the Solution/APP/webportal or at the charging station.
		<br><br>
		</h4>
		
		<strong><li> Communications and Updates</li></strong>
		<h4>
        By creating an account, You agree to receive communications from Company including, but not limited to email, push notifications, and/or text messages. These communications may include charging session notifications and final receipts. These communications are part of Your relationship with Company and You receive them as part of Your use of the Solution/services/products. You therefore hereby agree that any such notices, agreements, disclosures or other communications that Company sends to You electronically will satisfy any legal communication requirements. Furthermore, You understand and agree that installation of the App permits the downloading of updates and upgrades for the purpose(s) of fixing product defects or providing enhancements.
