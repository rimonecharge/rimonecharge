            <h4>How EV Charging Is Different From Filling Fuel Cars</h4>

                    <h4>Charging</h4>
                    <p class="hinfo">
                        Charging your EV is just like… charging your phone. Yes! Just like how people have different habits for charging their phones, EV drivers have different habits for charging their vehicles. Some people charge their phones at night while they sleep. Some charge at work at their desk. And others take advantage of chargers everywhere – in their car, at home, at the airport — wherever they can. So, the good news is that there are several options for how to charge your EV, just like there are for charging your phone.

                    <h4>Time to Charge</h4>
                    <p class="hinfo">
                        Currently, EV charging from zero percent to full takes time as compared to refilling petrol/diesel in the car. However, as the EV market is in the early stage, most people charge with EVs at home or place of work, saving a lot of time. But when in future EV market expands RIMONE has a plan of installing fast chargers too, which can charge your EV within few minutes.

                    <h4>EV's are EcoFriendly</h4>
                    <p class="hinfo">
                        Fossil fuels are coming to an end. These are non-renewable resources and will get exhausted one day. Fossil fuels produce a lot of harmful substances while burning such as smog, greenhouse gases, and other harmful substances.<br> Whereas electric vehicles produce zero carbon emissions. Also, PHEVs and HEVs are more efficient than ICE, they produce much fewer carbon emissions while running.

                    <h4>Pricing</h4>
                    <p class="hinfo">
                        Driving an electric vehicle will costs you less money than driving an ICE vehicle ( around 35% less). Fuel prices are not fixed and vary according to the market, whereas charging depends upon electricity which will be going to be cheaper with a renewable source of generation. The maintenance cost of EV's is very less as there are very few mechanical parts in the EV as compared to ICE vehicles. As the electric vehicle market is evolving simultaneously, reforms are being performed to make charging faster and economical.
